# Nonlinearity-MDL

This repository contains source codes for training and testing Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. 
This models were focused on mitigating nonlinearity in optical signal propagation.
We used Multi-domain learning approach (MDL) where multiple domains are different span/power/symbol rate in the transmission.

N.B. channel_model refers to module used for signal propagation with Manakov equation in 1 km step.


## Result for different symbol rates (SR) scenerios.
