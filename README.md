# Nonlinearity-MDL

This repository contains source codes for training and testing Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. 
This models were focused on mitigating nonlinearity in optical signal propagation.
We used Multi-domain learning approach (MDL) where multiple domains are different span/power/symbol rate in the transmission.


## Result for different symbol rates (SR) scenerios.
